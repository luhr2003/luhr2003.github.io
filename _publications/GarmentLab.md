excerpt: 'We present GarmentLab, a benchmark designed for garment manipulation within realistic 3D indoor scenes. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse range of garment types, robotic systems and manipulators including dexterous hands. The multitude of tasks included in the benchmark enables further exploration of the interactions between garments, deformable objects, rigid bodies, fluids, and avatars. '

We present GarmentLab, a benchmark designed for garment manipulation within realistic 3D indoor scenes. Our benchmark encompasses a diverse range of garment types, robotic systems and manipulators including dexterous hands. The multitude of tasks included in the benchmark enables further exploration of the interactions between garments, deformable objects, rigid bodies, fluids, and avatars.
