excerpt: "We leverage geometric consisency to fuse the views, resulting in a refined depth map and a more precise affordance map for robot manipulation decisions. By comparing with prior works that adopt point clouds or RGB images as inputs, we demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our method. "

We leverage geometric consisency to fuse the views, resulting in a refined depth map and a more precise affordance map for robot manipulation decisions. By comparing with prior works that adopt point clouds or RGB images as inputs, we demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our method.
