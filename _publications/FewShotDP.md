excerpt: "To reduce the number of required demonstrations for skill learning, we propose dynamics-guided diffusion policy. This method leverages learned dynamics models, which can explicitly model the interactions in a much wider space than the regions just covered by expert demonstrations."

To reduce the number of required demonstrations for skill learning, we propose dynamics-guided diffusion policy. This method leverages learned dynamics models, which can explicitly model the interactions in a much wider space than the regions just covered by expert demonstrations.
